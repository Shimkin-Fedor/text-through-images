# Text messages exchange through images
---
This program is able to encode a message within any picture (.png and .bmp formats are supported only right now).
The program consists of two parts: the encoder (encode.py) and the decoder (decode.py).
To use both programs, you need to install [Python 3.11](python.org) and [Pillow library](pypi.org/project/pillow/).

_May be updated/rewrited fully in the future._
